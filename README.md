# Analysis of the Academic Genealogy Graph in an Indian ETD Repository
In this work, we studied the academic genealogy network (AGN) in Shodhganga which is the Indian Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD) database. We have disambiguated the names of the researchers
in Shodhganga and constructed the Shodhganga-AGN, which we have analyzed with genealogical
metrics proposed in the literature to unravel several patterns in higher education.
